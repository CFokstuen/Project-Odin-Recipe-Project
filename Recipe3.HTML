      <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h5>Step 1</h5>
          <p>
            First, chop the onions and carrots with a sharp knife.
          </p>
        <h5>Step 2</h5>
          <p>
            Heat a large pot over a fire, and add the chopped onions and carrots to the pot.
            Stir occasionally until they start to soften.
          </p>
        <h5>Step 3</h5>
          <p>
            Add the diced meat to the pot and cook until it is browned on all sides.
          </p>
        <h5>Step 4</h5>
          <p>
            Add the beef or chicken broth, red wine, thyme, and rosemary to the pot.
            Season with salt and pepper to taste.
          </p>
        <h5>Step 5</h5>
          <p>
            Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 30 minutes,
            or until the meat is tender
          </p>
        <h5>Step 6</h5>
          <p>
            While the meat is cooking, make the pie crusts by combining flour, butter, and water in a bowl.
            Knead the dough until it is smooth, then roll it out with a rolling pin.
          </p>
        <h5>Step 7</h5>
          <p>
            Once the meat mixture is cooked, pour it into one of the pie crusts.
          </p>
        <h5>Step 8</h5>
          <p>
            Cover the meat mixture with the second pie crust, and crimp the edges together to seal them.
          </p>
        <h5>Step 9</h5>
          <p>
            Brush the beaten egg over the top of the pie crust.
          </p>
        <h5>Step 9</h5>
          <p>
            Bake the meat pie in a stone oven for about 45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.
          </p>
        <h5>Step 9</h5>
          <p>
            Let the pie cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!
