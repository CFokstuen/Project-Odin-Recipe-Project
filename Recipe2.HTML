            <h3>Directions</h3>
                <h5>Step 1</h5>
                    <p>
                    First, rinse the wheat berries and soak them overnight in water.
                    </p>
                <h5>Step 2</h5>
                    <p>
                    Drain the wheat berries, and place them in a large pot with enough water to cover them.
                    </p>
                <h5>Step 3</h5>
                    <p>
                    Bring the water to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer the wheat berries for about 1 hour,
                    or until they are soft.
                    </p>
                <h5>Step 4</h5>
                    <p>
                    Drain the wheat berries and return them to the pot.
                    </p>
                <h5>Step 5</h5>
                    <p>
                    Add the milk, honey, cinnamon, and ginger to the pot, and stir well.
                    </p>
                <h5>Step 6</h5>
                    <p>
                    Heat the mixture over a fire, stirring constantly, until it comes to a boil.
                    </p>
                <h5>Step 7</h5>
                    <p>
                    Reduce the heat and let the mixture simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
                    </p>
                <h5>Step 9</h5>
                    <p>

                <h5>Step 10</h5>
                    <p>
                    Take the pot off the fire and slowly pour in the beaten egg yolks,
                    whisking constantly to prevent curdling.
                    </p>
                <h5>Step 11</h5>
                    <p>
                    Return the pot to the fire and cook for another 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly.
                    </p>
                <h5>Step 12</h5>
                    <p>
                    Remove the frumenty pudding from the fire and pour it into a serving bowl.
                    </p>
                <h5>Step 13</h5>
                    <p>
                    Serve the frumenty pudding hot, garnished with a sprinkle of cinnamon, if desired.

                you can substitute some or all of the milk with cream.
