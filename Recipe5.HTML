      <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h5>Step 1</h5>
          <p>
            First, rinse the split peas and soak them in water for at least 2 hours.
          </p>
        <h5>Step 2</h5>
          <p>
            Drain the split peas and place them in a large pot with 6 cups of water.
          </p>
        <h5>Step 3</h5>
          <p>
            Add the chopped onion, carrots, celery, thyme, salt, and pepper to the pot, and stir well.
          </p>
        <h5>Step 4</h5>
          <p>
            Place the pot over a fire and bring the mixture to a boil.
          </p>
        <h5>Step 5</h5>
          <p>
            Reduce the heat and let the soup simmer for about 1 hour,
            or until the peas are soft and the vegetables are tender.
          </p>
        <h5>Step 6</h5>
          <p>
            Use a wooden spoon or a whisk to mash the peas and vegetables into a smooth and creamy soup.
          </p>
        <h5>Step 7</h5>
          <p>
            If the soup is too thick, add more water until it reaches the desired consistency.
          </p>
        <h5>Step 8</h5>
          <p>
            Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning, if necessary.
          </p>
        <h5>Step 9</h5>
          <p>
            Remove the soup from the fire and let it cool for a few minutes.
          </p>
        <h5>Step 10</h5>
          <p>
            Ladle the pea soup into bowls and serve it hot, accompanied by crusty bread or cheese.
          </p>
        <h5><strong>Note:</strong>For a heartier soup, you can add diced ham or bacon to the mixture,
          or use chicken or beef broth instead of water.
